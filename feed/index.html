<h2 data-start="3961" data-end="3990"><strong data-start="3961" data-end="3990">Chalet Prices in Ras Sidr</strong></h2>

<ol>
<li data-start="4230" data-end="4506"><strong data-start="4230" data-end="4250">Chalet Location:</strong> The first factor affecting chalet prices in Ras Sidr is the location of the chalet.
